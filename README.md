# Nested Routes

This project evaluates nested routes as implemented by the following frameworks:

1. [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
2. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
3. [Remix](https://remix.run/)

I have implemented the following pages along with the associated routes to
demonstrate the data loading behavior of the frameworks:

## Home Page

**Route**: `/` ![Home Page](assets/home.png)

## Holdings Page

**Route**: `/accounts/brokerage-account/holdings`
![Holdings Page](assets/holdings.png)

## Orders Page

**Route**: `/accounts/brokerage-account/orders/order-001`
![Orders Page](assets/orders.png)
