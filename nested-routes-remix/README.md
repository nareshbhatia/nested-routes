# Nested Routes Remix

## Development Build

This app makes API calls to an external server. First start this server by
following the instructions at
[Bullsfirst Server](../bullsfirst-server/README.md).

Now run this project from another shell:

```sh
yarn dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Production Build

First, build your app for production:

```sh
yarn build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
yarn start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.
